A temporary file system (TMPFS) uses local memory for file system reads and writes, which is typically much faster than reads and writes in a UFS file system. TMPFS file systems can improve system performance by saving the cost of reading and writing temporary files to a local disk or across the network. Files in TMPFS file systems do not survive across reboots or unmounts.

If you create multiple TMPFS file systems, be aware that they all use the same system resources. Files created under one TMPFS file system use up space available for any other TMPFS file system, unless you limit TMPFS sizes by using the -o size option of the mount command.
