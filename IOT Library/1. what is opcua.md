### Definition and Characteristics

**OPC UA** (short for Open Platform Communications United Architecture) is a data exchange standard for **industrial communication** (machine-to-machine or PC-to-machine communication). This open interface standard is independent of the manufacturer or system supplier of the application, of the programming language in which the respective software was programmed, and of the operating system on which the application is running.

The biggest difference to previous versions is that machine data can not only be transported, but also semantically described in a machine-readable way. [OPC UA provides access to a wide variety of data](https://www.spotlightmetal.com/initiative-for-opc-ua-high-pressure-die-casting-a-833432/) in both vertical and horizontal directions. The spectrum ranges from OPC UA components directly integrated on the devices and controllers or machines and systems to so-called gateways and aggregating servers.
