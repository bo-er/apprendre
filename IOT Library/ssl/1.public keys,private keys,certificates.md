# public-key cryptography

公钥密码法基于一个叫做`钥匙对`的概念，这个概念有`public key`跟`private key`.使用 public key 加密后的数据只能使用对应的 private key 解密。相反，被私钥加密的数据只能使用公钥解密。

- certificate:
  作用是验证一个实体是特定公钥的所有者。

  一个 certificate 包含下面的信息:

  - The Distinguished Name of the entity that owns the public key
  - The Distinguished Name of the entity that issued the certificate
  - The period of time during which the certificate is valid
  - The public key itself（也就是说证书就包含了公钥)



An organization that issues certificates can establish a hierarchy of CAs. The root CA has a self-signed certificate. Each subordinate CA has a certificate that is signed by the next highest CA in the hierarchy. A certificate chain is the certificate of a particular CA, plus the certificates of any higher CAs up through the root CA.
