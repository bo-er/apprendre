# What is a Namespace?

- Organise resources in namespaces
- Virtual cluster inside a cluster

实际上kubernetes启动的时候会创建4个namespace, 执行下面的命令查看:
```
kubectl get namespace
```
- `default` The default namespace for objects with no other namespace
- `kube-system` The namespace for objects created by the Kubernetes system
- `kube-public` This namespace is created automatically and is readable by all users  (including those not authenticated). This namespace is mostly reserved  for cluster usage, in case that some resources should be visible and  readable publicly throughout the whole cluster. The public aspect of  this namespace is only a convention, not a requirement.
- `kube-node-lease` This namespace for the lease objects associated with each node which  improves the performance of the node heartbeats as the cluster scales.
