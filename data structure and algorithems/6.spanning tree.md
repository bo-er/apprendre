## Introduction

一个旋转树是图 G 的子集，这个子集有着 G 的全部 vertices 并且有着最少的 edges，这意味着旋转树没有环形回路，并且它的全部 vertices 必须连接在一起。

> A spanning tree is `a subset of Graph G`, which has all the vertices covered with minimum possible number of edges. Hence, a spanning tree does not have cycles and it cannot be disconnected..

根据上面的定义可以得出结论: 每一个相互连接的无方向图 G 至少有一个旋转树。
一个不连接的图不可能有旋转树，因为它的旋转不能覆盖到每一个 vertice.

> By this definition, we can draw a conclusion that every connected and undirected Graph G has at least one spanning tree. A disconnected graph does not have any spanning tree, as it cannot be spanned to all its vertices.
