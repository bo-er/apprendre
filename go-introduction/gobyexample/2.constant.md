A const statement can appear anywhere a var statement can.

const declares a constant value.

Constant expressions perform arithmetic with arbitrary precision.

A numeric constant **has no type** until itâ€™s given one, such as by an explicit conversion.

A number can be given a type by using it in a context that requires one, such as a variable assignment or function call. For example, here math.Sin expects a float64.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math"
)

const s string = "constant"

func main() {
    fmt.Println(s)
    const n = 500000000
    const d = 3e20 / n
    fmt.Println(d)
    fmt.Println(int64(d))
    fmt.Println(math.Sin(n))
}

$ go run constant.go
constant
6e+11
600000000000
-0.28470407323754404

```
